# Plan: `<exp-name>` — <title>

> This page is the **current** best description of how to realise the idea. Rewrite it in place after every round that teaches something. The history is in `log.md`, next to this file.

## 1. The Idea
* **Idea:** [What we want to try, in one or two sentences. This part is stable: if it has to be replaced, close the experiment and open a new one.]
* **Why it is worth trying:** [The gap or Spark it answers, and how it serves `cortex/purpose.md`.]
* **Crossed with what the lab knows:** [Findings, claims, tensions, earlier experiments and Banlist entries that bear on it, and what they change. Say which of them the lab saw and which are only reported by an outside source.]
* **Alternatives considered:** [Other directions that were weighed and why this one was chosen. For one that is worth an experiment of its own: the `SPARK-nn` it was given in `JOURNAL.md`.]

## 2. What We Know and How We Will Do It
[The realisation, as exact as present knowledge allows and no more. May start high-level. Name the files, extension points and settings once they are known.]

* **Experiment Language** (from `cortex/systems/<repo>.md`):
  * **Extension point:** [Where the idea goes in.]
  * **Shared components used as they are:** [Data, run entry and config, runner, observation and analysis tools, evaluation.]
  * **What stays fixed:** [So that a difference can be attributed to the idea.]
  * **Added to or changed in the shared set:** [None | the new component or the fix, and why every later experiment should inherit it. If the Experiment Language itself is what changes, say that this is the idea.]

## 3. Open Questions
* [What the next rounds have to find out.]

## 4. Stopping Point
[Free text. What result would be enough. What would make it not worth continuing: a budget of GPU hours or rounds, a sign that the idea is exhausted. Reaching it is the moment to decide, with a reason, whether to conclude or go on.]
